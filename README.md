# Self-driving-car

This is the code I wrote with JavaScript for Self-driving car with (no libraries) :

The code will appear in progresses and will be divided into parts as follows:
  1. Car driving mechanics
  2. Road definition
  3. Artificial sensors
  4. Collision detection
  5. Traffic simulation
  6. Neural network
  7. Visualizing neural networks
  8. Optimizing neural networks
  9. Fine-tuning
